# Frequentist-Case-Study

The repository holds a frequentist inference case study included in the Springboard Data Science curriculum. This exercise is based on David Spiegelhalter's book, "The Art of Statistics." The Part-B notebook features a real-time dataset of a hospital administrator who is worried if the mean amount charged to patients has dropped below a certain threshold. The administrator also wishes to determine if the patients' insurance claims have any effect on the amount charged to them.
